# Digital Resume - Abbas Ashoury

As for its conception, this digital resume in consideration is built using HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.  
This was made to showcase my background, skills, and work in a fun and interactive way, different from a document.

## About the Project

The project started with the idea of creating a clean, responsive, and easy-to-navigate web page that stands in stark contrast to the old PDF version of a resume. It tries to show my love for web development and learning. A simple one-page design compliments smooth animations, section transitions, and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.

To use the project, simply grab a copy by downloading or cloning the repository and opening index.html in your browser:
